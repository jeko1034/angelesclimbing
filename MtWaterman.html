    <h2>Mt. Waterman</h2>
    <p>
      Mt. Waterman is a wonderful 8041ft peak in the San Gabriels which is mostly known for its innactive ski resort which once was a thriving local business.
      The history of bouldering on the tip top of the peak is non-existent, although Lance Carerra does have some boulders much lower on the peak which we still need to reach for documentation! In general, the possibities for good rock climbing on Mt. Waterman are totally endless.</p>
    <p>
      There's a gigantic boulder field at the top of the peak which you must reach by hiking at least 3 miles one way to get to. 
      Doing so with a crash pad is some work, but the climbing quality is worth every burnt calorie. The rock type stays pretty consistent but it much different than that of Winston Peak and Horse Flats.
      From our exploration, the better, more featured rock is north facing and lower on the slope which faces West Twin Peak.

    <h3>Surprise Boulder</h3>
    <p>
      This one is sort of close to the road and trailhead of Waterman. It's got a big tree trunk leaning against it and the problems are only visible from above the boulder looking down slope.

    <h3>Salad Bowl</h3>
    <p>
      In order to reach Salad Bowl, you must ascend Mt. Waterman then descend down the northern face. 
      Salad Bowl is below two big towers and sits on a mini ridge with a big drop off into a gully just behind it. 
      If you need help or want specific directions, please reach out to us.
