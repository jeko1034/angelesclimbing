    <h2>Winston Peak</h2>
    <p>
      Winston peak is this great peak next to Cloudburst Summit with a nice little trail to provide access to great views and fantastic boulders. The climbing here is great with most of it being climbed by the one and only Lance Carrera on the western ridge of the peak. The rock quality of the area varies but is unique compared to the rest of this belt of rock from Tunnel Crag to Horse Flats. As you hike further towards Winston Ridge, the rock gets sharper and more slick which begs the question if anyone is down to develop Winston Ridge!
    </p>
    <p>
      The following boulders on this guide are pretty sick and have a super easy approach to them. If anything on this site seemed too inaccessible for you and your friends, these bad boys are definitely here for you to easily enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, this is a huge work in progress so please contribute and climb out here.

    <h3>Jewel Pile</h3>
    <p>
      On the south ridge right off the trail to the left (if you’re going up.) Some cool traverse and some good easy warm ups. There are definitely some jewels here, just gotta get strong and climb them.
