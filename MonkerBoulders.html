    <h2>Monker Boulders</h2>
    <p>Oh the monker boulders&hellip; These 2 bad boys are deep in rockbound canyon sitting side by side in an open field of river rock. 2 gigantic boulders with tons of variety each, only partly developed. We must give credit for this find and development to Patrick Jackson, Chris Perez, David &ldquo;Dave&rdquo; Nieto, and Trevor Remedios since they took the time to clean these guys and clear some debris for fall areas. I did make a few trips to climb some of the easier problems here and I must say that this rock quality is fantastic for this part of the gabes.</p>
    <p>The approach is pretty simple and short with some light bushwhacking involved and a couple creek crossings. You&rsquo;d definitely want to bring some loppers for the brush, long sleeves and long pants for sharp things and poisonous plants. </p>
    <p>In terms of routes available and mapping out what boulder is which, we&rsquo;ll give you the following rundown. Monker A is the southern boulder while Monker B is the northern. Monker A has an overhung face that has no problems on it but maybe someone can claim something off it. Monker B has some good slab and some nice variations on the western face.</p>
